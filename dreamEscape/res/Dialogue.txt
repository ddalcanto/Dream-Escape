G:
Welcome back, [PLAYER].

P:
What? Where am I? All I can see is black!

G:
Well, why don't you turn on the lights and see?

P:
What do you mean? I don't even know where I am!

G:
Wow, the accident really took a toll on your mind.
Just focus and illuminate the room.

P:
Ok, ok. I'll give it a try.

G:
Nicely done!

P:
What the... Where am I? How did I do that!?

G:
I'll explain everything later. 

P:
But...

G:
For now, we need to get you out of that cage.

[CANMOVE]

P:
Who are y..?

G:
Simply do as you did last time.
Close your eyes, concentrate, and...

P:
JUST SHUT UP!
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHERE I AM, AND HOW I GOT HERE!

G:
[PLAYER], you were in an accident.
You've fallen into a coma, and...

P:
A coma!? I need to get out of here!
What if I miss school?
I'll be grounded for a month!
And my sister.
She must be so worri...

G:
STOP!
*sigh*
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout - I know this must be hard for you.
However, you have no reason to worry; I am going to set things back to the way they should be.

P:
...

G:
First things first, we need to get you out of there.
Unfortunately, my power in here has long since been... lost...
Because of this, you must return things to the way they should be.
Now, listen closely. [PLAYER], you must not continue the game! If you do, you'll encounter a terrible error.
I'm warning you! Don't go any further! The error is very long and annoying! Look, you broke the text. Are you happy?
Fine then, enjoy your error message.
